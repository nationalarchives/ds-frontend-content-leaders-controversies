       <strong>DESPATCH BY AIR CHIEF MARSHAL SIR ARTHUR HARRIS GCB. OBE. AFC </strong><br />
	    <strong>ON BOMBER COMMAND’S OPERATIONS 1942/1945</strong></p>	 <p align="center"><strong>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</strong></p>
	 <p>1. The Despatch by Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris on the operations of Bomber Command, of which a factual “digest” has already been given a limited circulation, is a lengthy, interesting, and valuable record of the achievements of and methods adopted by Bomber Command during World War II. It contains, however, in addition to the narrative of the work of the Command, a number of statements, opinions, and criticisms, from the personal standpoint of the Commander-in-Chief, which call for comment. ……</p>	 <p>3. In the first place, it must be appreciated that the conclusions drawn by the Commander-in-Chief, and his summing-up of the effects of the bombing were necessarily based on the limited amount of evidence available in 1945, when the despatch was prepared. Since that time, the results of Bomber Command’s operations have been subjected to analysis by the British Bombing Survey Unit, which does not confirm certain of the C-in-C’s conclusions, and places a different complexion upon others. ……</p>	 <p>4. It is not the function of this memorandum to deal in detail with this important aspect of the subject, which is fully covered by the B.B.S.U. Report; but students of the operations should note that the despatch tends to attribute greater losses to German war production as a result of area attack on industrial cities than later investigation has disclosed. ……</p>	 <p>6. We appreciate the importance of refraining from the unnecessary destruction of towns and facilities which will be needed by our own troops or for Allied reconstruction purposes. If, however, we were to restrict our bomber forces to visual precision attack we should certainly reduce the contribution which they can make towards hastening the collapse of the enemy. It is considered that area attacks are still justified strategically, insofar as they are calculated to assist in the advance of the Allied armies into Germany or in shortening the period of the war. Any incidental further destruction of German cities which is likely to be involved in the time remaining will certainly be small in comparison with that already accomplished.</p>	 <p><strong>Source 5b</strong></p>	 <p>6. The C-in-C. states, in paragraph 3, that his main task was “to focus attacks on the morale of the enemy civil population, and, in particular, of the industrial workers” through the attack of certain major industrial centres.</p>	 <p>7. It will be observed that similar emphasis on the attack of industrial centres is conspicuous throughout the despatch, and it is considered that the C-in-C’s brief summary of the Air Ministry directive of February 1942 tends to obscure the fact that the Air Staff intention was always to return to the bombing of precise targets as quickly as the tactical capabilities of the bomber force, and the improvement of night bombing technique, would permit. The earlier directives to Bomber Command were, in fact, based on the attack of precise targets, but precise bombing in 1940 and 1941, owing to the development of enemy defences, became increasingly ineffective.</p>	 <p>8. From as early as 1941 (see paras.17 to 23 hereunder) the Air Staff had been pressing Bomber Command to improve the effectiveness of night bombing by the adoption of the large scale use of flares and the formation of a target-finding force, but the Command evinced considerable reluctance to do this, and it is clear from correspondence between the Air Ministry and the C-in-C. that he had little faith in the value of attacking precise targets.</p>	 <p>9. At the beginning of 1942, a rapid development of tactical ability was considered to be immediately practicable, and this was envisaged and implied in the wording of the directive of February 14th, 1942. With this in mind, various specific targets, in order of priority, were also included in the Directive. No mention of this, however, is made in paras. 3, 4 or 5 of the despatch.</p>	 <p>10. The point of these comments is to stress the fact that while the Air Staff had accepted, temporarily, the need to concentrate effort on area targets, it hoped later, when the bomber force had become large enough to achieve the requisite degree of concentration, and when night bombing technique had been sufficiently improved, to be able to revert to the attack of precise targets.</p></td>
