JOHNSON SWORN IN AS SUCCESSOR</p>	<p>President Kennedy was assassinated yesterday in Dallas, Texas. Three shots were fired as the President’s open car passed near an intersection in the main business area of the city. He was hit in the head and died in hospital soon afterwards. Mrs. Kennedy was unhurt, but Mr. John Connolly, the Governor of Texas, who was riding with the President, was hit and gravely wounded.</p>	<p>Vice-President Lyndon Baines Johnson has been sworn in as the new President. He took the oath on board the presidential aircraft while it stood on Love Field, Dallas, preparing to fly to Washington. …</p>	<p><strong>Source 2b</strong></p>	<p>RIFLE NEAR WINDOW</p>	<p>From Our Own Correspondent</p>	<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 22</p>	<p>The assassination took place as the presidential party drove from the airport into the city of Dallas. One witness said the shots were fired from the window of a building. People flung themselves to the ground as armed policemen and Secret Service agents rushed into the building. A rifle with telescopic sights was found there. </p>	<p>The President was wounded in the head and collapsed into the arms of his wife. She was heard to cry, “Oh, no” as she cradled his head in her lap and the car, spattered with blood, speeded to Parkland Hospital.</p>	<p>The President was still alive when he reached the hospital. He was taken into an emergency room where facilities were said to be adequate. Two Roman Catholic priests were called and the last rites administered. Mr. Kennedy died at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (7 p.m. G.M.T.), about 35 minutes after the shots were fired.</p>	<p>Vice-President Lyndon Johnson escaped because his car, following the presidential vehicle, was delayed by the large crowds.</p>	<p>[Photo with the article has a caption:]<br />
