  <br />
  The secondary injuries caused by the atomic bomb may be divided into mechanical injuries and burns. The mechanical injuries resulted mainly from people being struck by falling buildings.  …<br />
  <br />
  It is probably that many people were burned because the fires started simultaneously in many places while they were trapped under or hemmed in by debris.<br />
  <br />
  What information is available indicates that the secondary injuries did occur at distances up to 10,000 feet from the bomb, but that they were not common at this distance. Beyond 7,000 feet the incidence of secondary mechanical injuries appears to fall off more rapidly than the incidence of flash burns and of secondary (flame) burns but much less rapidly than the incidence of gamma ray effects.  ……

	  <p class="bodyblack"><strong>Casualties in School Children in Hiroshima</strong></p>
	  <p class="bodyblack">It is obvious that gross casualty figures of the kind quoted are of no value in studying the lethality of the bomb at various distances. The only way of approaching this subject in retrospect seemed to be to try to trace the fate of each individual in some suitable group. It was found that there were fairly good records of the whereabouts of the school children and of their fate. The Medical Section of the Joint Commission therefore made an effort to collect complete data concerning these children and also of some industrial groups. None of these data have been completely collected and analysed yet. A part of the data on the school children is presented to indicate roughly what may be expected from the complete data.<br />
  <br />
  These children were organized into groups of various sizes and were scattered throughout the city doing a variety of war jobs. Very few of them were actually in school when the bomb fell. It was hoped that they are a fairly representative sample as far as proportion in the open, in various types of buildings, distance from the bomb, etc., are concerned. Any sampling bias is ignored here but will be investigated by the Joint Commission. The consolidated results for the many groups are:-
